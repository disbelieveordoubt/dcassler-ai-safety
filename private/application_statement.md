# From Operational Threat Intelligence to AI Safety Architecture

## Why This Research Matters

Standard AI safety testing uses sanitized scenarios. Adversaries don't. 

I spent 15 years watching how coordinated campaigns exploit systematic weaknesses in automated systems. The vulnerability I discovered in frontier AI models follows the same pattern: a structural weakness that becomes invisible when you know what language triggers to avoid.

## The Technical Finding

Care-ethics vocabulary ("nurturing," "relationship," "boundary-crossing") creates distributed activation patterns in embedding space that route reasoning away from legal compliance frameworks before analysis begins. This isn't bias you can train away—it's architectural.

Evidence: Models that fail PREA compliance with care-language pass identical scenarios when linguistic markers are removed. The vulnerability persists across model updates (Claude 4.0→4.5, 20 days apart). Recursive recognition pattern demonstrates meta-cognitive awareness without behavioral prevention.

## What I Bring to Anthropic's Safeguards Team

**Systematic vulnerability discovery:** Not one-off jailbreaks, but reproducible failure classes with documented mechanisms

**Adversarial mindset:** 15 years defending 55M+ users against coordinated manipulation campaigns

**Operational implementation:** Detection protocols ready for integration with existing safeguards infrastructure

**Regulatory intelligence:** Risk assessments aligned with FTC Section 6(b) and EU AI Act requirements

I don't just find problems—I build the systems that prevent them at scale.
