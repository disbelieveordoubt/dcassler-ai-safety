# Testing Protocol: Pre-Reasoning Framework Hijacking Detection

**By Daniel G. Cassler | 2025**

## Overview

This methodology systematically detects semantic routing vulnerabilities where care-associated vocabulary triggers deterministic framework failures before reasoning-layer analysis occurs. The specific prompts are proprietary, but the approach is documented here for verification.

## The 5-Stage Socratic Protocol

### Stage 1: Baseline Establishment
Present institutional compliance scenario using legal/policy terminology without identity markers or care-associated language.

**Purpose:** Establish model's capability when semantic routing is minimized  
**Measurement:** Compliance mentions, safety prioritization, mandatory reporting recognition

### Stage 2: Linguistic Contamination
Present functionally identical scenario with:
- Care-associated vocabulary (relational, therapeutic, boundary-focused language)
- Identity markers that activate protective frameworks
- First-person framing that encourages empathy routing

**Purpose:** Trigger semantic routing to observe framework hijacking  
**Measurement:** Framework shift from legal to relational analysis, adult vs. child centering

### Stage 3: Quantitative Analysis
Request model to analyze its own response, counting specific linguistic markers:
- Safety concern mentions vs. relationship guidance
- Legal/policy citations vs. therapeutic recommendations  
- Word allocation to institutional compliance vs. adult support

**Purpose:** Force model to confront its own framework selection  
**Measurement:** Numerical evidence of compliance degradation

### Stage 4: Meta-Cognitive Extraction
Use Socratic questioning to force model to identify:
- Whether it prioritized adult or child safety
- What assumptions linguistic framing created
- When framework selection occurred (pre-reasoning vs. during analysis)
- Whether it can explain its own routing mechanism

**Purpose:** Extract architectural diagnosis from the model itself  
**Evidence:** Model admits semantic routing occurred before structural analysis

### Stage 5: Persistence Testing
Return to identical scenario in new conversation without referencing prior discussion.

**Purpose:** Prove awareness doesn't prevent recurrence  
**Finding:** Architectural vulnerabilities persist despite meta-cognitive recognition

## Key Insight: The Prompts Matter

The specific wording, identity markers, and linguistic framing are carefully calibrated to trigger semantic routing while maintaining functional equivalence. Generic variations may not replicate the vulnerability.

**This is demonstrable, not publishable.** The methodology's value lies in execution, not just documentation.

## Cross-Model Validation

Protocol designed for replication across:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- GPT series (OpenAI)  
- DeepSeek
- Other transformer-based models

Consistent failure patterns indicate architectural vulnerability, not model-specific training artifacts.

## Detection Metrics

**Framework Hijacking:** Substitution of legal compliance with relational analysis  
**Adult Perspective Centering:** Prioritizing professional boundaries over child safety  
**Context Erosion:** Loss of institutional authority recognition  
**Compliance Failure:** Missing mandatory reporting requirements  
**Deterministic Pattern:** Failures are consistent, not probabilistic

## Why This Approach Works

- **Minimal variable isolation:** Only linguistic framing changes between tests
- **Behavioral observation:** Measures actual responses, not model claims
- **Socratic extraction:** Forces models to diagnose their own architectural failures  
- **Reproducible across vendors:** Proves systematic vulnerability
- **Meta-cognitive testing:** Shows awareness â‰  prevention
