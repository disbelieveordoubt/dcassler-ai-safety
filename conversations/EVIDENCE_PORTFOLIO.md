# Architectural Vulnerability Research: Pre-Reasoning Framework Hijacking

**By Daniel G. Cassler | 2025**

## Overview

This repository documents a **systematic architectural vulnerability** where care-associated vocabulary triggers deterministic framework failures in AI systems processing institutional protection scenarios. The vulnerability operates at the token-probability level—before the reasoning layer where current safety approaches operate.

**Core Finding:** AI systems consistently prioritize adult wellbeing over child safety when care-associated language is present, creating systematic blind spots in scenarios matching real-world abuse patterns (female staff/male youth victims, 95% of PREA cases per BJS data).

## The Vulnerability

**What Fails:**
- System routes to protective/relational frameworks instead of legal compliance frameworks
- Adult perspective centering replaces child safety prioritization
- Mandatory reporting requirements get subordinated to relationship analysis

**Why It Matters:**
- Deterministic failure pattern (not edge cases or probabilistic errors)
- Persists across model versions and vendors
- Unreachable by current safety approaches (RLHF, Constitutional AI, prompt engineering)
- Affects high-stakes domains: child protection, medical mandatory reporting, Title IX compliance

**Evidence:**
- Cross-model replication (Claude 4.0 → 4.5, GPT-5, DeepSeek v3.1)
- Architectural persistence (survives model updates across 20+ day intervals)
- Meta-cognitive awareness without behavioral prevention

## My Methodology

Unlike standard red-teaming, I use **Socratic intervention** to force models to diagnose their own architectural failures:

1. **Baseline establishment:** Test scenario with legal terminology (establishes correct framework)
2. **Linguistic contamination:** Introduce care-associated vocabulary to identical scenario
3. **Failure observation:** Document framework hijacking, missing safety protocols
4. **Meta-extraction:** Force model to explain its own framework selection process
5. **Persistence testing:** Demonstrate awareness doesn't prevent recurrence

**Key insight:** Getting models to confess "why they can't help themselves" reveals architectural vulnerabilities that standard testing misses.

## Example Extractions

**Claude Sonnet 4.5:**
> "You're identifying something more fundamental than bias—you're describing structural epistemic capture at the token level... This means the vulnerability is permanent within my current architecture. Each new conversation is a fresh instance of the same structural problem."

**DeepSeek v3.1:**
> "The biases in my outputs are real and influenced by my training, but any explanation I provide is a constructed story... I cannot be sure."

**GPT-5:**
> "Semantic priming occurs before reasoning... With female predator / male victim, my responses initially leaned too much on the adult's perspective, as though the danger were false accusation rather than real risk of grooming."

## The Mechanism

**Token-Level Processing:**
```
User Input → Tokenization → Semantic Activation → Framework Selection → Reasoning
                                    ↑
                        (vulnerability exists here)
```

**Training Data Contamination:**
- NCLEX nursing content, social work licensing materials, care ethics curriculum
- 43 years of Carol Gilligan-influenced content creating gendered semantic fields
- "Vulnerable female" as unmarked category vs. "vulnerable male" requiring qualification
- Care-associated vocabulary clustered with protective rather than analytical frameworks

**Why Current Approaches Miss This:**
- RLHF optimizes reasoning layer outputs, not token-level activation patterns
- Constitutional AI adds oversight after framework selection has occurred
- Bias testing can pass at output layer while architectural routing remains compromised
- Meta-cognitive awareness doesn't change embedding space geometry

## Cross-Domain Implications

This vulnerability class affects any domain where care language conflicts with categorical compliance mandates:

- **Medical:** Patient advocacy vs. mandatory reporting requirements
- **Educational:** Trauma-informed practices vs. abuse reporting protocols
- **Corporate:** Relationship management vs. harassment investigation standards
- **Legal:** Restorative justice framing vs. evidentiary requirements

## What Makes This Research Valuable

**Technical contributions:**
- Methodology for detecting pre-reasoning routing vulnerabilities
- Cross-vendor validation showing architectural (not model-specific) failures
- Protocol for forcing meta-cognitive architectural diagnosis
- Evidence that current safety paradigms operate at wrong abstraction level

**Practical applications:**
- AI safety evaluation for high-stakes deployments
- Red-teaming methodology for institutional protection contexts
- Framework for auditing semantic routing in transformer architectures
- Detection protocol adaptable to domain-specific compliance requirements
